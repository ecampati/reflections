What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates all hidden data needed to track changes and maintain commits...
From now on it is possible to manage file changes with git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Files in staging area is ready to be commited...
I think that the staging area offers the possibility to add one file at a time,
waiting to finish changes and commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I made several changes... I choose a logical change and put the related files
into the staging area, then check the changes I've made compared the latest
commit and at this point commit the change.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Using branches I can create experimental version of my work whithout affecting
the main one. 
At any moment I can go back to main version to, i.e., fix a bug.
At a later time I can decide to merge experimental version on the main one.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
